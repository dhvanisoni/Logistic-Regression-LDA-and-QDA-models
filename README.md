# Machine-learning-project

### BackGround

I choose Happy_Dataset for this project with 6 explanatory variables and 1 dependent variable. Based on independents variables our model predicts the personâ€™s happiness.
This project is based on creating Logistic Regression model on dataset to predict whether the person is happy or not.
Two discriminant analysis models which are Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and Quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA) were created for better models comparision.
For the EDA purposed Pandas profiling is created which is an automated EDA library in python.
Apart from the model creation, model analysis has been done for model comaprision and model selection.
